# Mnemotechnique
The Mnemotechnique part is composed of two sections at the moment:

- ‚úÖ PAO Insertion: The user can insert a Person-Action-Object (PAO) triplet and the corresponding information to associate with it. Both for the triplet and the information is possible to add an image.
- ‚úÖ PAO Base Training: In this screen the app will display an element of a random PAO triplet or a random information associated with a PAO triplet. The user can then try to remember the other elements and when he is ready he can check if he was right. The response time is saved and used to assign a score to each association, this score is used to decide which association to show next according to the [Forgetting Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve).
- üõ†Ô∏è PAO Training: Here is the real training which has this process:
    - A sequence of informations is proposed to the user (the number of informations is decided by the app depending on the user's performance).
    - The user has to memorize the sequence.
    - When he is ready he can write down the sequence and check if he was right.
    - The response time is saved and used to modify the score of each association used in the sequence.
