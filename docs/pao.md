# PAO

The PAO technique is a mnemonic system that helps to memorize a list of items. It is based on the association of a person, an action and an object. The idea is to create a vivid image of the person performing the action with the object.

This technique is well described on the [Art of Memory](https://artofmemory.com/blog/pao-system/) website.
